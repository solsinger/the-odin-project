    <p>Blue Corn Tortilla Chips might save your life. I like the Wegmans brand, but only the dipping kind because the other kind are contaminated with dairy.</p>

    <p>If you are here (and you are, or you wouldn't be reading this... [RED DOT]), then chances are you're <strong>suffering.</strong></p>
    <p>I'm sorry. I hope I can help.</p>

    <h6>About Me</h6>
    <p>I'm a woman experiencing extreme intestinal discomfort and pain due to a lifetime of self-neglect thanks to some bastards who raised me to ignore my body's warning signs.</p>
    <p>I have leaky gut syndrome from ignoring the fact that I cannot eat dairy for about 30 years and then doing dairy-based keto. Leaky Gut Syndrome can be repaired with various powders and potions, but, in the meanwhile, I have to figure out how to eat so I don't feel like crap day in and day out.</p>
    <p>You can tell if you have leaky gut syndrome by cutting out foods for 6 weeks and then trying them again. If they make you feel bad, you can't tolerate them and it's possible it's because of leaky gut. (The smaller the particle, the more it's likely to bother you.)</p>
    <p>Eat lots of collagen and gelatin, it'll help you become right as rain.</p>
