    <h1>Crystol's Thanksgiving Stuffing Soup</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head cauliflower</li>
        <li>1 large onion (OPTIONAL)</li>
        <li>1 sticks faux butter</li>
        <li>1 box of approved broth (chicken, turkey, whatevs)</li>
        <li>3-5 stalks celery</li>
        <li>1/2 bunch parsley, chopped (or dump a bunch in, if dried)</li>
        <li>1/2 TSP dried basil (about 10 shakes with a stingey shaker)</li>
        <li>1/2 TSP ground thyme (this one is best measured, but sprinkle it in at your own peril)</li>
        <li>1 TBS fresh rosemary, minced (or about three pinches of dried, broken into bits)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a nice large sauce pot on a burner.</li>
        <li>Dice the onion and celery. (Or cut it however you want, I don't care, just make it smaller, bro.) Put it in a bowl if you run out of space.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the bottom of the sauce pot on 5 or 6.</li>
        <li>Start cutting your cauliflower florets off.</li>
        <li>Once the butter is bubbling, toss the onion and celery in together. Stir every half minute.</li>
        <li>Cut the florets until you're happy with the size. (Or don't... this recipe isn't finicky.)</li>
        <li>Dump the cauliflower into the pot once you're finished and stir fry until it's your desired brownness.</li>
        <li>Dump in the herbs and stir fry until it's mixed together.</li>
        <li>Dump in the broth!</li>
        <li>Eat immediately because you totes just cooked all the veg and they're only gonna get softer the next time you reheat it.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This kind of monstrosity happens when you're gluten-free <em>and</em> grain-free. (Or fun-free, as I like to say. Everything great has gluten in it, amirite?)</p>
