    <h1>Crystol's Cakes</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 TSP salt (8-12 cracks from the Himalayan salt mill)</li>
        <li>2 sticks “butter” (Smart Balance “butter”, low sodium variety)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil (avocado oil for this girl)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup “sugar” (any sugar substitute meant for baking)</li>
        <li>1 TBS vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1+1/4 cup “milk” (unsweetened soy milk)</li>
        <li>3 cups “flour” (almond meal)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven at 350 F.</li>
        <li>Cream together salt, butter, oil, sugar, and vanilla extract. Mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Add 1.25 cups milk to the mixture, which will make it very runny. Mix thoroughly!</li>
        <li>Add any optional flavoring now and mix it up good!</li>
        <li>Stir in the 3 cups flour, one cup at a time for easy mode.</li>
        <li>Put into a 9x13 rectangular cake pan and bake for 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool for ~1 hour on a wire rack before attempting to frost. Cake should be barely above room temperature to the touch or your frosting will melt.</li>

    <h1>Crystol's Cookie Cakes</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups almond meal</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cassava flour (egg replacement)</li>
        <li>2 sticks plant-based butter</li>
        <li>2/3 cup Lakanto ‘golden’ monkfruit sweetener</li>
        <li>2/3 cup Lakanto ‘classic’ monkfruit sweetener</li>
        <li>1 TBS vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup flavoring of choice, such as peanut butter (OPTIONAL)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven at 350 F.</li>
        <li>Cream together ‘sugars’ and ‘butter’.</li>
        <li>Add extracts and any spices to creamed sugar/butter mixture and blend thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Add any extra flavorings of choice.</li>
        <li>Combine almond meal & cassava flour with creamed mixture. Mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Put in 9×9 baking pan or 13×9 pan. Bake at 350F for 40 minutes or 35 minutes, respectively.</li>
        <li>Cut immediately after retrieving from the oven or you’ll have a shattered cookie mess later. Allow it to cool for the consistency of a cookie. Eat immediately for a more cake-like experience. (The best of both worlds, if you ask me!)</li>
    </ol>

    <h6>Add-Ins:</h6>
    <p>Choose ONE unless you're incredibly brave. Reduce by half for cookie cakes.</p>
    <p>The pipe (|) means "OR" if you're not a programmer. &| is and/or.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (peanut | cashew | hazelnut | walnut | sunflower seed) butter (no sugar added)</li>
        <li>1 cup hazelnut butter (no sugar added), 1/2 cup cocoa powder for a Nutella taste</li>
        <li>1 cup of nuts, raw or otherwise</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dried fruit, 1/2 cup nuts</li>
        <li>1/2 cup seeds, 1/2 cup nuts</li>
        <li>1 cup <a href="trail_mix_1.html">trail mix</a></li>
        <li>1 cup tahini</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cocoa powder (chocolate cake)</li>
        <li>1 cup pumpkin puree, 1 TSP pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>1 cup minced carrots, 1 TSP ginger, 1 TSP cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 whole banana, mashed to smithereens</li>
        <li>1 cup minced carrots, 1/2 cup walnuts</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 cup coconut shreds (well-hydrated)</li>
        <li>3 TBS rose water | 3 TBS orange blossom water</li>
        <li>3 TBS orange blossom water, 1/2 cup shelled pistachio</li>
        <li>1 TSP ground cinnamon &| 1 TSP allspice</li>
        <li>1 pinch nutmeg (it'll have a vague donut vibe... be careful, it's easy to have too much nutmeg)</li>
        <li>1/2 to 1 cup apple sauce | apple butter | pumpkin butter</li>
        <li>a bag of sugar-free, dairy-free, & gluten-free baking chips (or half of one, if you're pretending you're not a heathen) - like choco chips, toffee chips, etc.</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen blueberries | raspberries | mixed berries</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded zucchini</li>
        <li>1 sugar-free, dairy-free white chocolate baking bar, melted or chopped up into chunks</li>
        <li>1 TBS maple syrup extract, 1 TSP cinnamon, 1 TSP allspice</li>
        <li>1 TBS (anything) extract, 1 cup of nuts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can absolutely take it from there. And, if you have a sense of adventure, you can combine any of these up to 1 cup semi-liquid addition + 1 cup dry ingredient addition. Try not to overdo the spices or you'll be throwing it in the trash!</p>
    <p>Remember this is practical chemistry, as well, and sometimes you're going to botch unless you start from something tried and true, like the base recipe. (I'm speaking from experience, yo.)</p>
    <p>TIP: Want your dried fruit to be softer in the end product? Simmer it for 10 minutes in water (or even OJ, honestly... something wet!) (Or you can microwave it for 30-60 seconds in room temperature liquid.)</p>

    <h6>Toppings:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Top with 3 TBS of cold 'butter' mixed with 1/4 cup "brown sugar" + 1 TSP cinnamon (combine into crumbs and top <strong>before</strong> baking!)</li>
        <li><a href="https://angelsansara.wordpress.com/2022/09/17/peanut-butter-cookie-cake/">Frosting!</a> (1 cup powdered "sugar", 2 sticks "butter", 1 TBS vanilla extract, 1 cup flavoring of choice)</li>
    </ul>
