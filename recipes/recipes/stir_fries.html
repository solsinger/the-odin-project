    <h6>Tips:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Variegate the way you cut up the vegetables for different experiences.</li>
        <li>Always cut up larger bits of veg in order to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Always pre-heat your oil in the pan for 2 minutes on 5 or 6 (medium heat, basically).</li>
        <li>Pre-cook any meat additions and add them in the last minute.</li>
    </ul>
