    <h6>Make It Yours:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Mix together a variety of seasonings to sprinkle over the wings. (Onion powder, garlic powder, basil, oregano are the ones I tolerate best these days, but you can use whatever you want.)</li>
        <li>Mix half and half: coconut oil + your favorite hot sauce. [Warm the oil until melted, duh.]</li>
        <li>Mix half and half: coconut oil + your favorite enchilada sauce. [Warm the oil until melted, duh.]</li>
        <li>Sprinkle fake parmesan all over it with melted fake butter. You can add some herbses if you like, as well.</li>
        <li>Serve it with a dip on the side. Maybe <a href="cashew_cream_and_uses.html">a cashew cream</a> sort of based dip?</li>
    </ul>
