    <h1>Crystol's Pixxa</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Wegmans cauliflower pizza crust (frozen food section)</li>
        <li>3 TBS avocado oil</li>
        <li>1/2 bag of plant-based shredded "mozzarella" (avoid turmeric and coconut if possible)</li>
        <li>Basil, to taste</li>
        <li>Oregano, to taste</li>
        <li>Garlic powder, to taste</li>
        <li>Onion powder, to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 onion, diced (OPTIONAL)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of minced meat, cooked (OPTIONAL)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat oven at 410 Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Take crust out of the freezer to thaw.</li>
        <li>Put on baking sheet/pan and cover with oil. Be generous or your cheese won't spread.</li>
        <li>Cover the oil and crust in dustings of your preferred spices. (Use what you can eat, I can't eat jack.)</li>
        <li>Cover in half a bag of "cheese." (Dairy is the devil and key to leaky gut syndrome for this girl.)</li>
        <li>Add veg and pre-cooked meats until it's no longer boring -- I provided some ideas in case your brain is off.</li>
        <li>Put into oven once it's fully pre-heated.</li>
        <li>Set a timer for 15 minutes. (My oven is old, your oven might be better... KEEP AN EYE ON THAT THING!)</li>
        <li>Switch to BROIL for 1-2 minutes if you like extra crispy toppings.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The reason this is called PIXXA is because I found out that you can only call it PIZZA if there's tomato sauce.</p>
    <p>That's right... there's no such thing as buffalo chicken pizza or white pizza. It's a myth!</p>
