    <h1>Crystol's Cooking Instructions</h1>
    <h3>Baking</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to the specified temperature. Modern ovens will tell you they are ready with a little BEEP. Then you put your food in and set a timer. If it can poison you, use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of your creation. #Don'tBeStupidLikeMe</beep></p>
    <h3>Boiling</h3>
    <p>Put water in sauce pan (POT). Put on stove top at mark 6 or 7 (medium high.) Wait for vigorous bubbles and add your foodstuffs. Stir until it changes color, which is your #1 solid indicator of doneness.</p>
    <h3>Stir Fry</h3>
    <p>Yeah, I know. You fry it and you stir it.</p>
    <p>My method: pre-heat pan for 2 minutes with a layer of oil coating the bottom. Add whatever you're stir-frying and swish it around until it looks deliciously golden-brown because otherwise how will you be satisfied? Never forget the salt!</p>

    <p>Because being limited to about 30 ingredients sucks balls, you need these skills. :)</p>
