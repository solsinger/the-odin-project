        <h1>Crystol's Hygge</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Always wear soft, comfy clothing with a texture that makes you melt.</li>
            <li>Put the softest sheets and blankets you can find on your bed (and couch, if applicable.)</li>
            <li>COMFY PILLOWS. Need I say more?</li>
            <li>Live life in pajamas, if you can! People suck, anyway, so put on your people clothes only when you must.</li>
            <li>Get plenty of sleep.</li>
            <li>Burn candles daily for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Clean a little every day, every step of the way.</li>
            <li>Get plenty of water.</li>
            <li>Make sure everything you eat makes your mouth sing. (Even if you burn it.)</li>
            <li>Drink coffee AND tea. Life is short.</li>
            <li>Meditate on how amazing it is to be alive.</li>
            <li>Go outside and thank nature for existing.</li>
            <li>Ruminate in gratitude.</li>
            <li>Look for the silver lining... there is <strong>always</strong> a silver lining.</li>
            <li>Kiss the chef!</li>
        </ul>
